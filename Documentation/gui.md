This file gives you a short introduction to the gui layout.

### Mockup
[Drawio-File](./GUI/MetaImageManager.drawio)  

<image src="./GUI/Library.svg" alt="Library Mockup">
The library (Bibliothek) is the landing page of the application, where the user can CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) albums of images.  

<image src="./GUI/Album.svg" alt="Album Mockup">
If an album is opened all the stored images including the most important metadata attributes are shown.  

<image src="./GUI/Attribute_Editor.svg" alt="Attribute-Editor Sidebar Mockup">
If an image is selected a sidebar for attribute editing opens on the right side of the application. One column describes the attribute and the other column has the attribut values, which can be edited directly.  

<image src="./GUI/Upload.svg" alt="Upload Mockup">
The Upload Page is used to upload new images to an album by choosing a Image with the Explorer. It also allows to edit the attributes before saving the image in the album.

The Header holds the Application Name and the current page the user is on.  

The Statusbar (Statusleiste) informs the user about any changes and shows additional information, i.e. how many elements are in the album or how many changes were made.
